*** CORRECT DICOM OUTPUT ****

Each DICOM file will have an image storage SOP. Common SOPs are defined in the standard here:
http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part04/sect_B.5.html

For each SOP there will be a collection of modules (which are a collection of tags).
Example for MR SOP: http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.4.html
Each module may be mandatory (M), conditional (C) or user defined (U)

To remove tags, mandatory and conditional (if present) modules should be replaced with
blank, randomised, or other placeholder data so as to create valid DICOM output.
User defined tags can be removed completely.

Tag IDs are split into 2, 4 hex-digit values; group and element.
The group value (the first half) is even for all tags defined in the standard.
Custom tags should always have an odd value for the group bytes (last bit is 1).
These should be removed completely (unless known and required).
